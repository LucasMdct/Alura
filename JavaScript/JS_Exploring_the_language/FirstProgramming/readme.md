 # Topics Covered:
   1. Const and Let: Learn about variable declaration using the const and let keywords, and understand their differences in terms of scope and mutability.
   2. Case Sensitivity: Understand how JavaScript treats variables and identifiers with different letter casings as distinct entities.
   3. Adding Comments: Explore the importance of code comments and how they enhance code readability by providing explanations and context.
   4. parseInt and parseFloat: Introduce the parseInt and parseFloat functions for converting strings into integers and floating-point numbers.
   5. Using Numbers with Decimal Places: Discover how JavaScript handles numbers with decimal places and get insights into floating-point arithmetic.
   6. Variable Assignment: Learn the concept of assigning values to variables and explore the flexibility that JavaScript offers in this aspect.
   7. Creating Arrays: We covered how to initialize arrays, which are data structures used to store multiple values in a single variable.
   8. Inserting Items into an Array: We explored various methods to add new elements to an existing array. This can involve both appending elements to the end and inserting elements at specific positions.
   9. Array Splice: We delved into the splice method, which allows us to add, remove, or replace elements at specified indices within an array.
   10. Reserved Keywords: We discussed the concept of reserved keywords, which are words that have special meanings in the programming language and cannot be used as identifiers like variable names or function names.
   11. Array Indices: We learned about array indices, which are numeric values used to access individual elements within an array. Indices start from zero and increase by one for each subsequent element.
   12. If and Else: We covered the basics of conditional statements using "if" and "else" in programming. These statements allow us to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.
   13. Logical Operators: We explored logical operators such as "&&" (logical AND) and "||" (logical OR). These operators are used to combine multiple conditions and create more complex decision structures.
   14. Chained "if": We learned about using multiple "if" statements in succession, allowing us to evaluate multiple conditions in sequence and execute corresponding code blocks.
   15. "else if": We delved into the "else if" statement, which lets us handle multiple alternative conditions in a more structured manner. This helps avoid unnecessary nesting of "if" statements.
   16. While Loop: We explored the "while" loop, which allows us to execute a code block repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true.
   17. Break Statement: We learned about the "break" statement, which prematurely terminates the execution of a loop or switch statement based on a specific condition.
   18. Using the VS Code Debugger: We introduced the use of the built-in debugger in Visual Studio Code. This enables us to inspect variables, step through execution, and identify issues in the code.
   19. Understanding Code Execution Flow: We discussed how code is executed line by line and how control structures like loops and conditionals affect this flow.
   20. Configuring the VS Code Debugger: We learned how to set breakpoints and configure other options in the Visual Studio Code debugger to analyze and debug our code effectively.
   21. For Loop: We introduced the "for" loop, a control structure used to execute a code block repeatedly for a specific number of times.
